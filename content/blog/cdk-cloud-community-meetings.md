# CDK Cloud Community Meetings

## Introducing AWS CDK Community Meetings

We are excited to announce our new community meetings series for the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) project. These meetings are designed to give everyone from seasoned contributors to new users a recurring opportunity to learn, ask questions, and share feedback directly with the AWS CDK team. We also see this as a great opportunity to engage with other members of the AWS CDK community.

## Why Community Meetings?

We originally considered forming a more formal governance model called the “Contributor Council”, but decided to pivot to a less formal, and more open and accessible format for a couple of reasons:

### Broader Inclusivity

We want to encourage participation from all interested developers, not just a small group.

### Simpler Engagement

A virtual meeting allows anyone in the community to attend, ask questions, and provide feedback without formalizing ownership or governance structures.

By hosting virtual community meetings, we can continue delivering the transparency and collaboration that the community values while retaining the flexibility to make decisions and drive the project forward with AWS as the maintainer of the project. We believe this is the best way to engage with our community in a meaningful way.

## How Frequently Can We Meet?

In order to ensure we make the best use of everyone’s time, we aim to meet twice every quarter. However, this schedule can get impacted by ongoing events and holidays, so we will publish the date of the next meeting along with the agenda in GitHub issues marked `[Community Meeting] – Date of meeting`.

## What to Expect

We are planning to cover a mix of the following topics based on interest and relevancy:

### Roadmap Updates

Get a sneak peek at upcoming features, enhancements, and project priorities.

### Team Demos

Our engineers will showcase new functionality or best practices in action.

### RFC & Vision/Feature Reviews

Provide direct input on proposed features or directions for the AWS CDK project.

### Open Q&A

A chance for you to ask questions directly to the AWS CDK team and fellow community members.

### Future Topics & Sessions

Additional events like community-led sessions or office hours may be introduced based on interest.

All sessions will be recorded and shared on YouTube, ensuring that anyone who can’t attend live can still catch up. We will also keep track of agendas and notes in GitHub issues marked `[Community Meeting] – Date`, so you can easily follow along with meeting highlights. If you have any questions or topics that you’d like to see covered in the meeting, please add a comment to the issue for the upcoming meeting.

## First Session: June 24, 2025

To support our global community, we’ll have two sessions on June 24 – the first meeting will take place at 8am PDT (.ics file), followed by the second session at 5pm PDT (.ics file). We’ll share meeting details, including joining instructions, in the cdk.dev Slack Workspace and on the CDK GitHub issues marked `[Community Meeting] – 6/24/25` beforehand.

## Why It Matters

The AWS CDK team remains dedicated to driving the project forward and maintaining ownership, while continuing to work in the open with the community. We value the input and perspective from the community as they are vital for shaping the future of the AWS CDK. These meetings provide a recurring forum for everyone in the community to have their voice heard in a direct and interactive way, beyond the traditional avenues like GitHub issues or pull requests.

## Take our survey

As a part of our commitment to build a strong and thriving community around the AWS CDK, we want to hear from you! Over the course of the year, we’ll be sending out surveys periodically to gain more insights into what’s working and where we can improve. Our first survey kicks off with this blog and will close on July 1, 2025. [Take the survey now](#)
